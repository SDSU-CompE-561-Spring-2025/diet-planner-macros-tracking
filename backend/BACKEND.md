Part 5: Additional Considerations
Authentication:

Users will authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Token).
Upon successful login, a JWT token will be issued and must be included in requests to access protected endpoints.

Middleware:

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) will be implemented to allow frontend applications to interact with the API.
Logging Middleware to track API requests and responses for debugging.

Error Handling:

Standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
